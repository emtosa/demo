# Levels
When writing software there are four different patterns or layers you need to be aware of. Level 1-3 are language agnostics, while the best practices (layer-4) is language agnostic e.g. c# best practices are different from javascript which is different for java and scala.

Level 1: Architecture level
High top level which detects how your components are going to be put together e.g. serverless, microservices
- Microservices arch can be done with javascript and nodejs, or c# for instance

Level 2: High level design
A high level design in a service states the general pattern or general organization of which the service would be developed e.g. Microservices can have a controller-service broker pattern

Level 3: Pattern(s)
How is the class operating e.g. of patterns SOLID, DI. 
This defines common themes of how the class is functioning or intended to be functioning
- SOLID principles

Level 4: Best Practices
How do you write the code? What are the best practices. How is the function written within the class?
These are programming language specific e.g. standardized and published by companies like Microsoft, Google, etc.
